# NovaOps AI — Full Layout Redesign v5 Spec

## CRITICAL RULES
- Keep ALL nav, footer, meta, head, scripts EXACTLY as-is
- Only rewrite the `<main>` content
- Preserve ALL existing copy/text word-for-word
- Keep data-theme attributes on html tags
- Calendar placeholder: `<div class="calendar-embed">Booking Calendar</div>` 
- Keep all existing links (tally.so, calendar, phone, email) exactly the same
- Add `reveal` class to sections for scroll animation
- Use CSS classes from style.css — avoid heavy inline styles
- Keep pages lightweight, no new libraries

## Design System
- Light mode, purple accent (#7c3aed primary, #a855f7 secondary)
- Fonts: Cabinet Grotesk (display), Satoshi (body), IBM Plex Mono (mono)
- Use CSS variables from style.css (--teal, --text, --bg-card, etc.)
